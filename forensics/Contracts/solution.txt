Since I am in a hurry mode, I use an online pdf editor tool: https://xodo.com/edit-pdf-text?step=view-and-edit-input

Basically this challenge is for us to find and reveal the hidden flag underneath the PDF. There are a lot of ways to do it like you can use
any PDF revealer tools but I am here to use a tool that is suitable for beginners.
